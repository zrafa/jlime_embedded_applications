  Nightsky is a very basic rendering of the stars in the sky for devices that
aren't powerful enough to run Stellarium.

  It's written in C and depends on SDL_image.


 LIMITATIONS

 + it renders only stars.  the Sun and the planets are not shown
 + the positions in the sky are slightly inaccurate
 + it requires you to know your latitude and longitude


 FEATURES

 + Shows the brightest 10,000 or so stars in the sky
 + The view can be zoomed in & out and panned around
 + Optionally shows the constellations and their names
 + Shows the configured location and time
 + Shows common names of stars


 GETTING STARTED

 + Copy /usr/share/nightsky/example-nightsky.yml to ~/.nightsky.yml and edit it
   to reflect your location
 + Run "nightsky" and press [F1] to see the key bindings


 THANKS

  + To the Stellarium team for some of their data, the documentation of their
    data formats and their choice of license.
  + To everyone on the Internet who published their equations and pseudo-code
    for calculating the positions of objects in the sky
  + To everyone who made the Ben NanoNote happen
  + To the Open Source community regardless of the license you choose
