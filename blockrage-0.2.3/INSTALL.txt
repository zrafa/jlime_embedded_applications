                 Block Rage - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
	         ======================================

0. BEFORE YOU START
===================

  UNIX/LINUX
  ----------
  To compile and run the game under a UNIX or GNU/Linux system
  you need:
  
    libSDL 1.2.x (just the core library)

  and the usual: gcc, make.
  
  NOTE: If you installed libSDL using a prebuilt package, you
  might also need a development package, such as libsdl-dev.
  
  WINDOWS
  -------
  To compile for win32 you need a working Cygwin environment.
  You must also compile and install SDL - from the source!!
  
1. CONFIGURING
==============

  Block Rage uses a 'configure' script that works in a similar way
  as those created by GNU Autoconf. Thus the default install directories
  are:
  
    bindir: 	/usr/local/bin
    sysconfdir:	/usr/local/etc
    datadir:	/usr/local/share
    mandir:	/usr/local/man

  And the game's files will be installed there (under a blockrage/ subdir).
  If you feel that's perfectly ok, than you might just type:
  
    ./configure

  to configure the game with default directories. BUT, this directory
  layout is actually quite unusual and doesn't (in my opinion) comply
  to the FHS. I would recommend that you configure Block Rage using
  the command:
  
    ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/games --sysconfdir=/etc/games\
--datadir==/usr/local/share/games

  and use a similar configuration for all your games. This is (IMHO)
  the way games are meant to be installed in the FHS, but
  the choice is yours alone.

2. COMPILING AND RUNNING
========================

  To compile, simply type
  
    make

  If successful, the file blockrage[.exe] will be created. Try it:
  
    ./blockrage[.exe]
    
  should run the game.
  
  WINDOWS
  -------
  To run the game from outside the Cygwin
  bash shell you need to find a SDL.dll somewhere and copy
  it to the same directory where blockrage.exe resides.


3. INSTALLING INTO UNIX DIRECTORY TREE
======================================

  Once the game is compiled you can install it into the directory tree
  by typing:
  
    make install
    
4. UNINSTALLING FROM THE UNIX DIRECTORY TREE
============================================
  Just go to the blockrage-<version>/ directory and type:

    make uninstall
