    version 0.2.2
    -------------
    
    Updated the documentation.
    
    blockrage-fhs.rc is not in the sources anymore. It is created by
    configure to reflect the directories for which the game is configured.
    
    The behavior of 'configure' is now closer to standard GNU configure
    scripts. Now supports configuring installation directories,
    and has same default ones.
    
    Makefile now supports DESTDIR to install into other location than
    the root dir (support for Gentoo ebuild)
    
    FIX: 'inst' script now handles multiple successive slashes in pathnames
    correctly (e.g /usr//local)
    
    BUGFIX: The SDL_QUIT event is now recognised, sets quit=1 (like ALT-X),
    quit==1 handling corrected, now you can exit from any place in the game
    using the cross buttonin window caption, by pressing ALT-X or by sending
    a SIGABRT to the game. -- thanks to Matej
		  
    BUGFIX: fix several getenv(<VAR>) calls not being checked for NULL result.
    This cased for example the hall of fame to crash when you gained a high
    score and the USERNAME environment variable was not set. (Which is
    LIKELY to happen!)
		  
    FIX several other getenv(<VAR>)s, safer handling of most pathnames
		  
    FIXED name editing in topscores, now using a simple US
    key-to-character mapping.
		  
    BUGFIX: block fall speed would not be updated on level advance until
    you pressed the drop key. -- thanks to ericsp
    
    FIX: Makefile fixes

    version 0.2.1
    -------------
    
    16th Sep 2005 Reorganised the directory structure - moved
                  'configure', README and co. out of src/
    
    15th Sep 2005 Changes to graphics due to the upcoming release,
                  also replaced the sound effect with some new ones
		  (quick and dirty.)

    12th Sep 2005 Updated inst.	Updated the documentation, added a manpage.
                  FIX: add -lm link flag: math lib used by
		  bg.c, needed on non-GNU systems.

    11th Sep 2005 Revised installation procedure: replaced
                  mkinstalldirs (a public domain script) by
		  a more clever "inst".
    
    10th Sep 2005 Applied new name to the source code. Updated

    25th Aug 2005 Registered the game as a SourceForge project
                  and renamed it to Block Rage.
    
    23rd Aug 2005 Added a simple configure script to detect
                  Cygwin automatically (detects executable suffix
		  and whether it's necessary to use -lwinmm)
		  
		  Idea to rename the game to HotBlock

    22nd Aug 2005 Started adding 16bit directcolor support
                  to avoid palette management during graphics
		  development.
