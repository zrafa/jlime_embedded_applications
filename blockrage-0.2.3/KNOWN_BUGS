                    Block Rage 0.2.3 - KNOWN PROBLEMS
                    =================================

* not enough frames will be dropped if your machine is EXTREMELY slow
  (displays about 1 frame/second) due to numeric overflow
  -- you are highly unlikely to encounter that :)

(windows problems are possibly caused by SDL misbehavior)
* windows: when you toggle fullscreen or doublesize with ALT+Enter/Backslash,
    ALT gets stuck and you must press and release it again
    (otherwise instead of Enter - select in menu you get ALT+Enter)

* windows: switching from fullscreen to windowed mode doesn't work
    for some unknown reason under WinXP the window does not appear
    in this case

* windows: the audio skew is BIG

* the directcolor screenshot writing is a mess

* security
	- no protection for shared topscore table yet

* highscores
	- there is only one topten table for all difficulties/starting levels,
	  thus on multiuser systems with shared table this might be unfair

* background speed
	- currently, some background will slow down if your machine is slow
	and Block Rage drops frames

* configuration
	- the fullscreen and doublesize settings are not
	  accessible from the menu
