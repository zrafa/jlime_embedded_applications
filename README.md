jlime_embedded_applications
===========================

All the modified ports made for Jlime Muffinman -  Rafael Ignacio Zurita <rafaelignacio.zurita@gmail.com>

JLime Muffinman was built using openembedded.
All these applications here are extra software, which we modified from
original sources, to adapt them to tiny screens (320x240) and few
resources (32MB of RAM and slow MIPSEL CPU).

Some nice work are snesx (might be the fastest super nintendo emulator ever
we have) and the offline wikireader :)
