? MCHIP: 16MHz Xtal or 20MHz?

Go 20Mhz!  Should not be a problem.  Maybe some baud rate misalignment with the
other chips.

? MCHIP: Xtal capacitor size justification?

? Xtal package pin check to datasheet?

V Chip

? 16MHz Xtal or 20MHz or other?

? Xtal capacitor size justification?

? Pin 1 marked?  OK

? Crystal capacitor value justification?  OK Atmega328 datasheet recommends 12 - 22 pF

Video DAC

? Diode Requirements?

OK. Diodes make low outputs look like a disconnect - ie, they won't sink any current.  

? Voltage levels expected?

OK - taken from tellymate.  video device supplies 75 ohm termination.

MOSI=0V, PB1=0,  OUT=0V (Sync level)
MOSI=5V, PB1=0,  OUT=5V*75/(330 + 75)  = .93V (unused??)
MOSI=0V, PB1=5V, OUT=5V*75/(1000 + 75)= .35V (black level)
MOSI=5V, PB1=5V, OUT=5V*75/(248 + 75)= 1.16V (white level, slightly high)

? Do I need termination resistor?

OK - No.  some tellymate versions don't even have the option.

VICSP

? Pin 1 marked?  OK

? Schematic vs ICSP pinout?

? No buffer resistor on V RESET/DIO9?  
OK - possible but unlikely contention with M Chip if software error.

? Should/can KBCLK be on an interrupt line?

PICSP

? Pin 1 marked?  OK

?Schematic vs ICSP pinout?

? No buffer resistor on P RESET/DIO8?
OK - possible but unlikely contention with M Chip if software error.

? Buffer resistor sizing R30, R31 and R32?  OK

? L1 LED silkscreen marking?

USB IF

? Justification for 2.2k pullup on D-?

If P Chip output is high impedence, then this will pull D- to 3.6V, expected by
spec (opposite of D+).

? USB clamping diode spec? OK

? Current through R50 and R51 during clamped operation?

OK.  (5V - 3.6V)/68 = 20 mA

? Main board power supply bypass capacitor sizes?

OK.  Shotgun, but can be changed later if really needed.

? Are Calibration marks appropriate? OK - adjusted according to web sources

? USB connector grounding?

FIXED - For shielded USB 2 cables, the shell must be connected to ground.
Intel recommends an optional ferrite bead on ground, power, and shell as well.
I'm skipping the ferrite.

? Verify USB pinout to datasheets? OK

? L2 power LED current calculation? OK - 5V/1000ohm = 5mA - low but used in Arduino

? Keyboard connector pinout? OK

? Arduino Power Expansion Header pinout?

? Arduino Expansion Header orientations?  Power - Analog - DIO1 - DIO2

? SD Card power requirements?

27 - 90 mA?  http://forum.brighthand.com/showthread.php?t=187443

-"The normal cards have a peak current of about 40mA when doing a write and the
high-speed cards are about 60mA." -
-"the spec allows an SDHC card to draw up to 200 mA. Although, we've found
measured some high speed SDHC cards draw up to 450 mA."
http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/112554-1.php

FIXED - Switched to 100mA regulator in same SOT89 package almost same price.
(can go much higher if needed in same package and price)

? Do I need 3.3V regulator bypass cap?

FIXED - Uzebox had a 10uF cap, so I've added one.

? Audio out value justification?

? Is fuse too fussy?

OK - Intel recommends a 500mA fuse.

?IR2 recv pinout verification? OK

? SD Card pinout verification? OK

? SD Card connector grounding? FIXED - grounded 

? IR LED current calculation? FIXED - Reduced to 13 mA, transistor remove.

? IR LED PNP transistor selection and spec? FIXED - removed.

? Full schematic CRC check? FIXED

PCB

? Silkscreen on via?

OK - Mostly harmless except for legibility.  FreeDRM doesn't complain.  Will
clean up as I see them.

? Silkscreen clearances?

? Via near bypass cap verification? OK

? Trace clearance?

? Board edge clearance?

? Board thickness?

? What other Atmega chips are compatible?

BOM

- Digikey order formation

- Mouser order formation

- Update BOM  DONE

? Crystal footprint verification? OK

? switch footprint verification?

? RCA footprint verification?

? RCA tip/shield orientation? OK

? 0603 resistor footprint?

? fuse footprint?

? 0603 cap footprint?

? Regulator footprint?

? LED footprints?
