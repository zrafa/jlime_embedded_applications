This is a offline wikireader I wrote for JLime in Ben Nanonote!

It lets users to read wikipedia pages in their tiny Ben Nanonotes
with just 32MB of RAM and without internet access :)

A complete dump wikipedia is needed. And it must be
prepared for this application. Read the Jlime web pages where
we wrote instructions to have the wikipedia dump.
