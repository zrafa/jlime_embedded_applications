ERRATA - TVIKIA zc19a - 1/9/10

-Pin 1 on Atmegas is not marked except for covered dot.

-Via clearance with pads could be better

-L1/L2 cathode not marked

-3.3V Regulator smoke - incorrect footprint

-Crystal 8pf driving 22pf caps, Atmega datasheet recommends
12-22 pF.

-Add tantalum power cap?

-Fix Video/Audio color coding to RCA connector.

-Find RCA connector without panel screwhole protrusion.

-Both Audio Out and button S4 are on DIO5, leading to a clicking noise
and conflict.

-LED1 is on the SPI SCK line, which makes it pretty much useless if using the
SD Card.  This is the same line the Arduino uses, but should be changed to make
the LED useful for Tvikia.

-Check SD Chip Select line for compatability with the various Arduino Ethernet
and Wifi shields (most seem to hog the SS line).

-Insufficient clearance around drill holes for spacers or nuts.

-Odd size of drill holes (bit bigger than #4, smaller than #8 - maybe
#6 screws??)

-Only three drill holes, need four.
