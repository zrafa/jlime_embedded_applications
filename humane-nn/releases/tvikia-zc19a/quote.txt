Please give me a rough quote for PCB fabrication and assembly of the
attached project (gerbers & bom included).

The design has the following general specifications:

-Rectangular shape 3.2" x 2.1" inches
-no internal drill routing or irregular shapes
-8mil trace width/space
-2 sided board with silkscreen and soldermask
-11 through-hole components
-60 SMT components
-No components with less than 30mil pitch
-No BGA/QFN/Leadless components
-Double sided SMT (SMD on both sides of boards)

I currently have five prototypes.  I need quotes for small production
runs of 100 units (April), 1,000 units (July), and 10,000 units (end of
2010 if all goes well).  Quotes should include both PCB fabrication and
assembly.  One month or longer turn-around time is acceptable.

Approximate quotes are acceptable at this stage - the gerbers are not
final, I will probably have minor fixes and revisions as I continue to
test my prototypes.

I assume I will be providing parts, unless you can provide at least
generic passives.  Do you also provide procurement services, and part
recommendations?

Also, how much extra is conformal coating?

Thank you,
