TVIKIA ZC19A TEST AND SETUP PROCEDURE

Off Circuit Resistant Measures:

-V+ to GND: 500< x <1k ohm
 POWER.3 to POWER.4

-POWER.1 to MICSP.5: x < 1 ohm

-Audio Jack Tip to GND: x > 500

-PICSP.1 to J6.4 330 < x < 1k (MOSI)

-PICSP.3 to J6.6 330 < x < 1k (SCLK)

-PICSP.4 to J6.5 330 < x < 1k (MISO)

-VICSP.5 to J6.2 x < 100 (VRESET/DIO9)

-MICSP.1 to J6.5 x < 50 (MISO)

-MICSP.3 to J6.6 x < 50 (SCLK)

-MICSP.4 to J6.4 x < 50 (MOSI)

-IC1 (3.3V reg) pin 3 to GND x > 500

-IC1 (3.3V reg) pin 3 to IC1 pin 2 x > 500

-J5.6 to Audio Jack ~= 47k

-Audio Jack to Audio Ground >500 ohms

-Check for shorts among all USB pins with connector inserted

Off Circuit Diode Checks (polarization matters!):

-VICSP4 to Video Jack Tip 330<x<1M
-Video Jack Tip to VICSP4 1M<x
-GND to +5V (reverse polarity) = 47k
-Check L1 LED polarity to GND
-Check L2 LED polarity to GND

POWER ON

-Check Top L2 LED ON!
-POWER.3 to POWER.4 (GND) = 5V
-POWER.1 to POWER.4 (GND) = 5V (MRESET)

OSCILLISCOPE: 
-Q20 Crystal to Gnd: 90 mV p-to-p, 63 ns wavelength (16 MHz)

AVRISP:
sudo avrdude -vvv -B 8 -F -c avrispmkII -p m168 -P usb
Check for "device signature".

-Optional: BlinkApp
BlinkApp Program with time test - should blink PORTD every 16 seconds (if F_CLK=16MHz)
test with Peizo Buzzer from positive J5.7 to GND J6.7 (optional 100 ohm resistor)
cd tviki/software/; scons ARCH=avr F_CPU=16000000
cd build/atmega168p-16/apps
sudo avrdude -vvv -B 8 -F -c avrispmkII -p m168 -P usb -Uflash:w:BlinkApp.hex:i

WARNING: Don't run BlinkApp on multiple MCU's at the same time, they will drive
the bus in opposition!  

-Optional: Burn Nop (no operation) program to flash to clear BlinkApp:
sudo avrdude -vvv -B 8 -F -c avrispmkII -p m168 -P usb -Uflash:w:Nop.hex:i

-Burn Fuses to set oscillator, program chips.

For each ICSP (VICSP, MICSP, PICSP) header, connect ICSP programmer and run the following to burn the fuses for the external oscillator:
sudo avrdude -vvv -B 8 -F -c avrispmkII -p m168 -P usb -U lfuse:w:0xd6:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xf9:m

NOTE: You'll get the message "efuse changed! Was f9, and is now 1.
Change back?".  Just say no.  This is due to "don't care" bits in the
fuse which don't get set.

-OPTIONAL: BlinkApp should now blink PORTD every 1 second

-Video MCU - Connect to VICSP header
cd tviki/software/3rdParty/tellymate-114/
make
sudo avrdude -vvv -B 8 -F -c avrispmkII -p m168 -P usb -Uflash:w:main.hex:i
Check for video out signal and blinking cursor (NOTE: WHITE connector is video out, not RED).

-Main MCU - Connect to MICSP header
cd tviki/software/build/tests
sudo avrdude -vvv -B 8 -F -c avrispmkII -p m168 -P usb -Uflash:w:test_helloworld.hex:i

The hello world test program should start printing a line every second, and
keyboard and button input should be displayed.  Test buttons and keyboard.
